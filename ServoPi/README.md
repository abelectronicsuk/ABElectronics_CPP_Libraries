# Class: Servo #

The Servo class provides functions for controlling the position of servo motors commonly used on radio control models and small robots.  The Servo class initialises with a default frequency of 50Hz and low and high limits of 1ms and 2ms.

Initialise with the I2C address for the Servo Pi.  

```
Servo(uint8_t address, double low_limit, double high_limit, bool reset, bool use_oe_pin)
```
**Parameter:** address - i2c address for the ServoPi board, defaults to 0x40  
**Optional Parameter:** low_limit - Pulse length in milliseconds for the lower  servo limit. (default = 1.0ms)  
**Optional Parameter:** high_limit - Pulse length in milliseconds for the upper servo limit. (default = 2.0ms)  
**Optional Parameter:** reset - true: reset the servo controller and turn off all channels .  false: initialise with existing servo positions and frequency. (default = true)  
**Optional Parameter:** use_oe_pin - true = Enable the Output Enable pin on the GPIO port. false = Output Enable pin not used. Defaults to true.

Methods:
----------

```

**Parameter:**  channel - 1 to 16

**Optional Parameter:** steps - The number of steps between the the low and high servo limits.  This is preset at 250 but can be any number between 0 and 4095.  On a typical RC servo a step value of 250 is recommended.  
**Returns:** null

```
get_position(channel, steps=250)

Usage
====

**PWM Class**

To use the Servo Pi PWM class in your code you must first import the class:
```
from ServoPi import PWM
```
Next you must initialise the PWM object:
```
pwm = PWM(0x40)
```
Set PWM frequency to 200 Hz and enable the output
```
pwm.set_pwm_freq(200)  
pwm.output_enable()  
```
Set the pulse with of channel 1 to 1024 or 25% duty cycle
```
pwm.set_pwm(1, 0, 1024) 
```

**Servo Class**

To use the Servo Pi Servo class in your code you must first import the class:
```
from ServoPi import Servo
```
Next you must initialise the Servo object:
```
servo = Servo(0x40)
```
Set PWM frequency to 50 Hz
```
servo.set_frequency(50)  
```
Move the servo on channel 1 to position 125 out of 250 steps  
```
