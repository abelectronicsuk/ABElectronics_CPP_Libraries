AB Electronics UK IO Pi C++ Library
=====

C++ Library to use with IO Pi Raspberry Pi expansion board from https://www.abelectronics.co.uk

The example demo files can be found in /ABElectronics_CPP_Libraries/IOPi/demos  

**Note:** Microchip recommends that pin 8 (GPA7) and pin 16 (GPB7) are used as outputs only.  This change was made for revision D MCP23017 chips manufactured after June 2020. See the [MCP23017 datasheet](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/docs/pdf/microchip-mcp23017.pdf) for more information.
